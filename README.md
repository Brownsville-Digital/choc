The Chocolate Factory
=====================

The Chocolate Factory is a lightweight JavaScript DOM manipulation library,
inspired both positively and negatively by jQuery, React.js, and others.
Its goals are:

1. Be extremely lightweight. Just import it and use it, no build system, no
   node_modules, nothing. This should be easy and convenient for use on
   places like GitHub Pages, where build systems are not available.
2. Work directly with DOM objects where practical. This includes both the
   element objects and all ancillaries, such as event objects. Discrepancies
   should be unusual and well-justified.
3. Leave power in the hands of the programmer. It's not Choc Factory's job to
   tell you how to write your code.
4. Behave naturally and predictably whenever possible.

This repository also includes tools related to the Chocolate Factory, but
using the library requires just one file, factory.js.
